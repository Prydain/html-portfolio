<h1>The Best Movies According to Brian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time (subject to change daily).</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>I consider all 3 one movie. No movie has ever come close to replicating
    the experience I had seeing these movies in the theater!
</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Great sci-fi movie with great acting and soundtrack.</p>
<h3>Edward Scissorhands</h3>
<p>Weird, touching, and visually appealing.</p>
